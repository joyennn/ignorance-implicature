# Semantic and pragmatic perspectives on ignorance implicature in VLMs

This study explores how Vision-Language Models (VLMs) interpret ignorance implicatures, focusing on the effects of context (precise and approximate contexts) and modifier type (bare numerals, superlative, and comparative modifiers). Using GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, we conducted a truth-value judgment task in visually grounded settings. The results indicate that while both models exhibit sensitivity to semantic factors (modifier), their pragmatic factors (context) fail to produce human-like patterns. Specifically, superlative modifiers were more strongly associated with ignorance implicature than comparative modifiers, supporting the semantic view. However, the influence of context was weaker and inconsistent across models, suggesting limitations in pragmatic inference. These findings highlight the need for further advancements in VLMs to enhance their ability to integrate linguistic and contextual information for human-like pragmatic reasoning.
